I am a UTIG Postdoctoral fellowship holder at UTIG who works on terminus variation at glaciers in Greenland. I am currently working with [Prof. Ginny Catania](http://www.catania-ice.org/) and [Prof. Daniel Trugman](https://www.unr.edu/geology/people/daniel-trugman) to automate the delineation of glacier termini using Deep Learning technology and multi-sensor remote sensing images. Before starting at UT, Enze received a PhD in Earth System Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong working with [Prof. Lin Liu](https://cryocuhk.github.io/), and a BS in geophysics from The University of Science and Technology of China.
